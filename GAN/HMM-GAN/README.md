README
to run: python3 run.py
I utilized gpt to organize my ipynb so that my project is easier to run, for graphs, and used gpt 
Files: 

- Data(folder) 
    - contains our train, validation, test data (s00, s03, s02)
- jupyter note book file (main.ipynb) - annotated and easier to follow through the process
- run.py calls the other python files(data_prep, eval_gan, gan_dataset, hmm, gan_model, train_gan, parameters).py 
- Final_Project_writeup.pdf is the final project write up
